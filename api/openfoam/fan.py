"""Optional mixing fan: a meanVelocityForce fvOption applying a body force
within a small cylindrical cellZone to maintain a target mean velocity
there, e.g. a ceiling fan aimed downward to improve room mixing.

Deliberately not an actuator-disk thrust model (Cp/Ct coefficients) - a
real fan in an otherwise-still room has no meaningful upstream flow for
that model to act on (it assumes air already moving *through* the disk,
like wind through a turbine, not a fan generating flow from stillness).
meanVelocityForce sidesteps this: it directly forces the zone's average
velocity to a target, whatever body force that takes.

Unlike the UV/contaminant-source scalarSemiImplicitSource entries, this
acts on U within the main solve itself (not through the scalarTransport
function object), so it's relevant during flow convergence too - a real
fan affects the converged flow field, not just the later scalar-transport
phases. constant/fvOptions is auto-loaded by any solver directly (see
run_pipeline.converge_flow_field's docstring), so no controlDict splicing
needed here either.

Verified empirically against a real solve (see commit history): the
nested <type>Coeffs{} wrapping style (matching this module's own
scalarSemiImplicitSource entries elsewhere) works, confirmed by the log's
"Pressure gradient source: uncorrected Ubar = ..." line showing the body
force genuinely driving the zone's velocity, not silently ignored.
