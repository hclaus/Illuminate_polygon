"""Splice constant/fvOptions into the scalarTransport function object's
nested fvOptions{} block inside system/controlDict.

We're not running a normal solver that reads constant/fvOptions on its own -
the UV scalar transport is handled by the `scalarTransport` function object
attached in controlDict, which only sees sources copy-pasted into its own
nested fvOptions{} sub-block. Every time the mesh (and therefore
constant/fvOptions' cellZone contents) is regenerated, that nested block goes
stale and must be re-spliced with the fresh content.
